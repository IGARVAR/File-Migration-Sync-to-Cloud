# File-Migration-Sync-to-Cloud

**Data migration and sync automation from on-prem to cloud (SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams).**  
Scripts focused on audit, structure alignment, metadata cleanup, and upload automation for hybrid or cloud-first environments.

Can be used as pre-ingestion audit for Copilot/LLM readiness validation
Hereâ€™s what I use when helping orgs move 100k files from on-prem to M365, while cleaning and aligning naming, structure, and metadata.
Used in multi-tenant migration across 450 GB of content in different business units
